# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BentonSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/BentonSans Black.otf
        - asset: fonts/BentonSans Bold.otf
          style: normal
    - family: BentonSans1
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/BentonSans Book.otf
        - asset: fonts/BentonSans Medium.otf
          weight: 700
